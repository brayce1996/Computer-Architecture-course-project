# Computer-Architecture-course-project
The course project of Computer Architecture which I took at 2016 Spring

## Project 1: Single-cycle functional processor simulator and self-designed testcases for it
a. Implement a single-cycle functional processor simulator.
b. Design your own test case to test the functionality of your simulator.

See project1 for more detail spec. and project description.

## Project 2: Pipelined, functional processor simulator for the reduced MIPS R3000 ISA and self-designed testcase for it
a. Implement a pipelined, functional processor simulator for the reduced MIPS R3000 ISA,
following the specification “Datasheet for the Reduced MIPS R3000 ISA” in Appendix A
b. Design your own test case to validate your implementation, particularly on hazards handling.

See project2 for more detail spec. and project description.

## Project 3: MIPS CPU simulator with memory hierarchy, Translation-Lookaside Buffer (TLB), and virtual page table mechanism
a. Based on the single-cycled CPU simulator from project #1, implement a MIPS CPU
simulator with memory hierarchy, Translation-Lookaside Buffer (TLB), and virtual page table mechanism. The memory size, page size, cache total size, block size and set associativity of the cache should be configurable.
b. Design and submit your own test case to verify the functionality of the memory hierarchy configuration.

See project3 for more detail spec. and project description.
